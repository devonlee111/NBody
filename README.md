# NBody Simulation
This is my first attempt at creating a functional N-Body Simulation.
This simulation is implemented the Barnes-Hut algorithm to perform my simulation in order to achieve a runtime complexity of O(n logn).

# Current Progress
No Major progress in implementing the algorithm yet.
The Quadrant class, used to represent quadrants in 2D space, has been completed.

# TODO
Complete the Body class
Create and complete the quadtree for the algorithm.
Complete the main class to run the simulation.
Implement a gui to show the simulation.
